## directories ######
##
Directory for storing ncmpcpp related files.
Changing it is useful if you want to store
everything somewhere else and provide command
line setting for alternative location to config
file which defines that while launching ncmpcpp.
##
#
ncmpcpp_directory = ~/.ncmpcpp
#
##
Directory for storing downloaded lyrics. It
defaults to ~/.lyrics since other MPD clients
(eg. ncmpc) also use that location.
##
#
#lyrics_directory = ~/.lyrics
